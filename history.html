                History
            </h1>
            <h2>
                Early years (1878–1945)
            </h2>
            <p>

                Manchester United were formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon
                department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath. The team initially
                played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in
                their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were
                defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team. By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The
                Combination, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season,
                Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged
                with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the First Division,
                by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the "LYR" from its name.
                After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.

            </p>
            <p>
                In January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £370,000 in 2025 – the club was served with a
                winding-up order. Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies (who
                became club president), each willing to invest £500 in return for a direct interest in running the club
                and who subsequently changed the name; on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born. Under
                Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, Manchester United finished as Second Division
                runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 – the club's
                first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield and ended
                with the club's first FA Cup title. Mangnall was considered a significant influence behind the team's
                move to Old Trafford in 1910, and Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911.
                At the end of the following season, however, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.
            </p>
            <p>
                Relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again
                in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in
                the Second Division in 1934, under secretary-manager Scott Duncan, narrowly avoiding relegation to the
                Third Division. Two years later, Duncan led the club to promotion before another relegation followed in
                1937, which led to his resignation in November of that year. Following the death of principal benefactor
                John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United
                would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested
                £2,000 and assumed control of the club. In the 1938–39 season, the last year of football before the
                Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Busby years (1945–1969)
            </h2>
            <p>
                In October 1945, the impending resumption of football after the war led to the managerial appointment of
                Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and
                training sessions. Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA
                Cup victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years. They
                then won back-to-back league titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, who had an average age of 22, were
                nicknamed "the Busby Babes" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players. In 1957,
                Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from
                The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season. En route to the
                semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 10–0 victory over Belgian champions
                Anderlecht, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star
                Belgrade, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while
                attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958
                claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players – Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan
                Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan – and injured several more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assistant manager Jimmy Murphy took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the
                club's makeshift side reached the FA Cup final, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of
                the team's tragedy, UEFA invited the club to compete in the 1958–59 European Cup alongside eventual
                League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite approval from The Football Association, The Football
                League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified. Busby
                rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Pat Crerand, who combined
                with the next generation of youth players – including George Best – to win the FA Cup in 1963. Busby
                rested several key players for the League game before the Cup Final which gave Dennis Walker the chance
                to make his debut against Nottingham Forest on 20 May. Walker thus became the first Black player to
                represent United. The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965
                and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup, beating
                Benfica 4–1 in the final with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year: Bobby
                Charlton, Denis Law and George Best. They then represented Europe in the 1968 Intercontinental Cup
                against Estudiantes of Argentina, but defeat in the first leg in Buenos Aires meant a 1–1 draw at Old
                Trafford three weeks later was not enough to claim the title. Busby resigned as manager in 1969 before
                being replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.
            </p>
            <h2>
                1969–1986
            </h2>
            <p>
                Following an eighth-place finish in the 1969–70 season and a poor start to the 1970–71 season, Busby was
                persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve
                team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18 months
                before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972. Docherty saved Manchester United from
                relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and
                Charlton had left the club. The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in
                1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2–1.
                Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club
                physiotherapist's wife.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe
                Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to win any trophies; they finished
                second in 1979–80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even
                though the team won the last seven games under his direction. He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who
                immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from his former club West
                Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup in 1983 and 1985 and beat rivals
                Liverpool to win the 1983 Charity Shield. In 1985–86, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15
                matches, the club was favourite to win the league but finished in fourth place. The following season,
                with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Ferguson years (1986–2013)
            </h2>
            <p>
                Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal,
                and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league. Despite a second-place finish in 1987–88, the
                club was back in 11th place the following season. Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's
                job was saved by victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup final. The following season, Manchester
                United claimed their first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup title. That triumph allowed the club to compete in the
                European Super Cup for the first time, where United beat European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1–0 at
                Old Trafford. The club appeared in two consecutive League Cup finals in 1991 and 1992, beating
                Nottingham Forest 1–0 in the second to win that competition for the first time as well. In 1993, in the
                first season of the newly founded Premier League, the club won their first league title since 1967, and
                a year later, for the first time since 1957, they won a second consecutive title – alongside the FA Cup
                – to complete the first "Double" in the club's history. United then became the first English club to do
                the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995–96, before retaining the league title
                once more in 1996–97 with a game to spare.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1998–99 season, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and
                UEFA Champions League – "The Treble" – in the same season. Trailing 1–0 going into injury time in the
                1999 UEFA Champions League final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored late goals to claim a
                dramatic victory over Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time.
                That summer, Ferguson received a knighthood for his services to football.
            </p>
            <p>
                In November 1999, the club became the only British team to ever win the Intercontinental Cup with a 1–0
                victory over the strong 1999 Copa Libertadores winners Palmeiras in Tokyo. The Red Devils counted on an
                unexpected goalkeeper fail by future 2002 FIFA World Cup winner Marcos and a disallowed goal scored by
                Alex to win the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Manchester United won the league again in the 1999–2000 and 2000–01 seasons, becoming only the fourth
                club to win the English title three times in a row. The team finished third in 2001–02, before regaining
                the title in 2002–03.[55] They won the 2003–04 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3–0 in the final at the
                Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to lift the trophy for a record 11th time. In the 2005–06 season,
                Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first
                time in over a decade, but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan
                Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup final. The club regained the Premier League title in the
                2006–07 season, before completing the European double in 2007–08 with a 6–5 penalty shoot-out victory
                over Chelsea in the 2008 UEFA Champions League final in Moscow to go with their 17th English league
                title. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in that game, overtaking previous record
                holder Bobby Charlton. In December 2008, the club became the first British team to win the FIFA Club
                World Cup after beating LDU Quito 1–0 in the final. Manchester United followed this with the 2008–09
                Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title. That summer, forward Cristiano
                Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record £80 million. In 2010, Manchester United defeated
                Aston Villa 2–1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first successful defence of a knockout cup
                competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                After finishing as runners-up to Chelsea in the 2009–10 season, United achieved a record 19th league
                title in 2010–11, securing the championship with a 1–1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May
                2011. This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012–13, securing the championship with a 3–0 home win
                against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Post-Ferguson years and struggles (2013–present)
            </h2>
            <p>
                On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season,
                but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. He retired as the most decorated manager
                in football history. The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him
                from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract. Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months
                later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend
                their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since
                1995–96. They also failed to qualify for the UEFA Europa League, the first time Manchester United had
                not qualified for a European competition since 1990. On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van
                Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant.
                Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch of the family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under Van Gaal, United won a 12th FA Cup, but a disappointing slump in the middle of his second season
                led to rumours of the board sounding out potential replacements. Van Gaal was ultimately sacked just two
                days after the cup final victory, with United having finished fifth in the league. Former Porto,
                Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid manager José Mourinho was appointed in his place on 27 May 2016.
                Mourinho signed a three-year contract, and in his first season won the FA Community Shield, EFL Cup and
                UEFA Europa League. Wayne Rooney scored his 250th goal for United, a stoppage-time equaliser in a league
                game against Stoke City in January 2017, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as the club's all-time top
                scorer. The following season, United finished second in the league – their highest league placing since
                2013 – but were still 19 points behind rivals Manchester City. Mourinho also guided the club to a 19th
                FA Cup final, but they lost 1–0 to Chelsea. On 18 December 2018, with United in sixth place in the
                Premier League table, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool and 11 points outside the Champions League
                places, Mourinho was sacked after 144 games in charge. The following day, former United striker Ole
                Gunnar Solskjær was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. On 28 March 2019, after
                winning 14 of his first 19 matches in charge, Solskjær was appointed permanent manager on a three-year
                deal.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 18 April 2021, Manchester United announced they were joining 11 other European clubs as founding
                members of the European Super League, a proposed 20-team competition intended to rival the UEFA
                Champions League. The announcement drew a significant backlash from supporters, other clubs, media
                partners, sponsors, players and the UK Government, forcing the club to withdraw just two days later. The
                failure of the project led to the resignation of executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, while resultant
                protests against Woodward and the Glazer family led to a pitch invasion ahead of a league match against
                Liverpool on 2 May 2021, which saw the first postponement of a Premier League game due to supporter
                protests in the competition's history.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the pitch, United equalled their own record for the biggest win in Premier League history with a 9–0
                win over Southampton on 2 February 2021, but ended the season with defeat on penalties in the UEFA
                Europa League final against Villarreal, going four straight seasons without a trophy. On 20 November
                2021, Solskjær left his role as manager. Former midfielder Michael Carrick took charge for the next
                three games, before the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager until the end of the season.

                On 21 April 2022, Erik ten Hag was appointed as the manager from the end of the 2021–22 season, signing
                a contract until June 2025 with the option of extending for a further year.[94] Under Ten Hag,
                Manchester United won the 2022–23 EFL Cup, defeating Newcastle United in the final to end their longest
                period without a trophy since a six-year span between 1977 and 1983. On 5 March 2023, the club suffered
                their joint-heaviest defeat, losing 7–0 to rivals Liverpool at Anfield. At the end of the following
                season, the club finished eighth in the Premier League, their lowest league finish since the 1989–90
                season, but went on to beat cross-city rivals Manchester City 2–1 in the FA Cup final, to win their 13th
                FA Cup title. On 28 October 2024, Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag after the club managed just
                three wins in the opening nine games of the Premier League season. On 1 November 2024, Manchester United
                announced that they would be appointing Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim as their new head coach from 11
                November 2024.
